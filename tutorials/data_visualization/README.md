# Data exploration and visualization

John Novembre

- loading large data sets using readr of tidyverse
- dealing with missing data
- organizing and tidying data
- exploratory plots, univariate, bivariate

Note: the students in the advanced track get some brief intro to tidyverse (including ggplot). The other students (~2/3) do not.
