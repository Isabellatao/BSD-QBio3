# Reproducibility of data analysis

Sarah Cobey

- organizing data and code (directory structure)
- writing notebooks in Rmd
- seeding the random number generator
- basic version control in Git
- collaborating, sharing

Note: I (Stefano) have a lot of material already written for Git. Happy to share.
